# Off-the-wall ideas

This file is a temporary dumping ground for the slightly more outlandish ideas while I make up my mind whether they're interesting or not.

Warning: may just be nonsense.

## Just the files

Here's a thought exercise: how far could you get with just files alone? No server or API. Build up the annotations in a JSON file. Let the reader download the file via a link that has the `download` attribute and a Blob url for the file as a href.

Then let them open that file on another computer if they want to continue their annotations. Store it in IndexedDB on the page. Annotations interoperability without a server? Is opening and downloading a file manually really less convenient than the account/authentication song and dance that every user would need to do with a server API?

## Weirdo Cryptography tactics for authentication

Public-key cryptography? No? (I don't think that has ever been a user-friendly option.)
